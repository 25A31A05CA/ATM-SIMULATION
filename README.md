The ATM Machine Simulation is a C language–based program that models a basic banking terminal by providing PIN verification, cash withdrawal, and balance enquiry features. It uses loops to repeatedly display a secure, menu-driven interface, while arrays and files are used to store multiple account details and update balances after each transaction. This project helps learners understand how fundamental C concepts can be combined to implement a realistic ATM workflow with simple error handling and data persistence.
